# Driver-retention
"Sample of what was calculated to take a deep look at driver churn within a trucking company."

First lets look at all of the files and their purpose, then I will post the results and how they can be implement to slow driver churn and in turn save the company money. After all isn't that the reason data analysis is done?


Each of the included files were areas that were looked into to try to determine the bestway to slow driver churn. 

"Teaming characteristics" - This was done to look at what impact the person who you were co-driving with had on how long you would stay. This included things like experience level, number of previous partners, preferred sleep schedule, etc. 

"Textmining3_6" - This is text mining to get a feel for what drivers had expressed through their responses to survey questions. This looks at sentiment either positive or negative and commonly occuring words and themes. 

"Retention Query"- Looks at difference in pay, pay codes used, time on the job, etc. between those who stayed and those who left.
